In the epidermis (Top layer), algae attract retain moisture through polysaccharides, which are natural molecules in algae that act as humectants, binding to water molecules and holding them on the skin's surface, keeping it hydrated and soft. In the dermis (Middle layer), some algae types, particularly those rich in peptides and amino acids, can penetrate deeper to stimulate collagen production and improve skin elasticity, addressing fine lines and firmness at a structural level. In the basal layer (Deepest layer)<strong> </strong>of the epidermis, certain bioactive compounds in algae support skin renewal by reaching the basal layer, where new skin cells are formed, promoting a more radiant and smoother complexion.</p>"

However, botanical extracts are far more complex they’re highly concentrated forms of a plant’s most potent compounds, carefully extracted to harness their specific benefits. In reality, they work to control sebum, minimize pores, hydrate and moisturize, calm irritation, and soothe the skin. They enhance radiance, promote a glowing complexion, reduce dark circles and puffiness, even out skin tone, and improve smoothness, addressing a wide range of skincare needs with precision. </p>"
